# dp-legacy-cache-proxy

The proxy handles the cache headers for pages within the legacy CMS and sits between the Frontend Router and Babbage.

It receives requests from dp-frontend-router and redirects them to Babbage -
returning the response with the correct `Cache-Control` header.

All the requests that users make to Babbage (or any other services that rely on the Legacy Cache API for caching
purposes, like the Release Calendar) will go through this Proxy first. When Babbage sends the response back to the user,
this Proxy will intercept it and decide whether it needs to set the `max-age`/`s-maxage`/`stale-while-revalidate`
directives in the `Cache-Control` header to appropriate values.

## Getting started

- Run `make debug` to run application on [http://localhost:29200](http://localhost:29200)
- Run `make help` to see full list of make targets

### Dependencies

## Auto-Deployment of secrets

Functionality has been added to the nomad plan so that when the secrets are deployed to Vault, this will automatically
cause Nomad to trigger a redeployment of the application to pick up the new secrets. :warning: **Please note that this functionality
does not appear to work** with the current nomad/vault versions, but if these are upgraded it may then become functional.
