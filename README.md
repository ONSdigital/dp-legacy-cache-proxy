# dp-legacy-cache-proxy

The proxy handles the cache for pages within the legacy CMS and sits between the Frontend Router and Babbage. It
receives requests from dp-frontend-router and redirects them to Babbage with the correct Cache-Control header.
All the requests that users make to Babbage (or any other services that rely on the Legacy Cache API for caching
purposes, like the Release Calendar) will go through this Proxy first. When Babbage sends the response back to the user,
the Proxy will intercept it and decide whether it needs to set the max-age directive in the Cache-Control header to an
appropriate value.

## Auto-Deployment of secrets

Functionality has been added to the nomad plan so that when the secrets are deployed to Vault, this will automatically
cause Nomad to trigger a redeployment of the application to pick up the new secrets. Please note that this functionality
does not appear to work with the current nomad/vault versions, but if these are upgraded it may then become functional.
